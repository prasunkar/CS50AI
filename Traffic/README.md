## üåâ Background

As research continues in the development of self-driving cars, one of the key challenges is  [computer vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision), allowing these cars to develop an understanding of their environment from digital images. In particular, this involves the ability to recognize and distinguish road signs ‚Äì stop signs, speed limit signs, yield signs, and more.

In this project, I use  [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)  to build a neural network to classify road signs based on an image of those signs. To do so, I need a labeled dataset: a collection of images that have already been categorized by the road sign represented in them.

Several such data sets exist, but for this project, we‚Äôll use the  [German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=news)  (GTSRB) dataset, which contains thousands of images of 43 different kinds of road signs.

## üßê Understanding

First, take a look at the data set by opening the  `gtsrb`  directory. You‚Äôll notice 43 subdirectories in this dataset, numbered  `0`  through  `42`. Each numbered subdirectory represents a different category (a different type of road sign). Within each traffic sign‚Äôs directory is a collection of images of that type of traffic sign.

Next, take a look at  `traffic.py`. In the  `main`  function, we accept as command-line arguments a directory containing the data and (optionally) a filename to which to save the trained model. The data and corresponding labels are then loaded from the data directory (via the  `load_data`  function) and split into training and testing sets. After that, the  `get_model`  function is called to obtain a compiled neural network that is then fitted on the training data. The model is then evaluated on the testing data. Finally, if a model filename was provided, the trained model is saved to disk.

## üß™ My Experimentation Process

My initial goal was to solely gain the maximum accuracy possible, given the dataset. I started with large amounts of hidden layers and one of both a convolutional and output layer, all with slightly differentiating settings and saw what came out of it. Evidently, this did not work as well as I intended, mainly due to immense training times/ETAs and lackluster results. I gradually removed one hidden layer at a time, further tweaking the settings to what I saw fit. This resulted in massive improvements, with an average accuracy increase of 5-7% per iteration. I repeated this cycle various times until I was content with the outcomes.

In the future, I intend to focus on achieving maximum efficiency instead of accuracy, as this will give more training value to the neural network. Of course, I will continue to improve on the accuracy through more intelligent use of the variety of layers, as long as the neural network maintains exemplary growth in knowledge and speed.
