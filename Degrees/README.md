# üïµÔ∏è Degrees Project

Write a program that determines how many ‚Äúdegrees of separation‚Äù apart two actors are.

## üåâ Background

According to the  [Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon)  game, anyone in the Hollywood film industry can be connected to Kevin Bacon within six steps, where each step consists of finding a film that two actors both starred in.

In this problem, we‚Äôre interested in finding the shortest path between any two actors by choosing a sequence of movies that connects them. For example, the shortest path between Jennifer Lawrence and Tom Hanks is 2: Jennifer Lawrence is connected to Kevin Bacon by both starring in ‚ÄúX-Men: First Class,‚Äù and Kevin Bacon is connected to Tom Hanks by both starring in ‚ÄúApollo 13.‚Äù

We can frame this as a search problem: our states are people. Our actions are movies, which take us from one actor to another (it‚Äôs true that a movie could take us to multiple different actors, but that‚Äôs okay for this problem). Our initial state and goal state are defined by the two people we‚Äôre trying to connect. By using breadth-first search, we can find the shortest path from one actor to another.

## üßê Understanding

The distribution code contains two sets of CSV data files: one set in the  `large`  directory and one set in the  `small`  directory. Each contains files with the same names, and the same structure, but  `small`  is a much smaller dataset for ease of testing and experimentation.

Each dataset consists of three CSV files. A CSV file, if unfamiliar, is just a way of organizing data in a text-based format: each row corresponds to one data entry, with commas in the row separating the values for that entry.

Open up  `small/people.csv`. You‚Äôll see that each person has a unique  `id`, corresponding with their  `id`  in  [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/)‚Äôs database. They also have a  `name`, and a  `birth`  year.

Next, open up  `small/movies.csv`. You‚Äôll see here that each movie also has a unique  `id`, in addition to a  `title`  and the  `year`  in which the movie was released.

Now, open up  `small/stars.csv`. This file establishes a relationship between the people in  `people.csv`  and the movies in  `movies.csv`. Each row is a pair of a  `person_id`  value and  `movie_id`  value. The first row (ignoring the header), for example, states that the person with id 102 starred in the movie with id 104257. Checking that against  `people.csv`and  `movies.csv`, you‚Äôll find that this line is saying that Kevin Bacon starred in the movie ‚ÄúA Few Good Men.‚Äù

Next, take a look at  `degrees.py`. At the top, several data structures are defined to store information from the CSV files. The  `names`  dictionary is a way to look up a person by their name: it maps names to a set of corresponding ids (because it‚Äôs possible that multiple actors have the same name). The  `people`  dictionary maps each person‚Äôs id to another dictionary with values for the person‚Äôs  `name`,  `birth`  year, and the set of all the  `movies`  they have starred in. And the  `movies`  dictionary maps each movie‚Äôs id to another dictionary with values for that movie‚Äôs  `title`, release  `year`, and the set of all the movie‚Äôs  `stars`. The  `load_data`function loads data from the CSV files into these data structures.

The  `main`  function in this program first loads data into memory (the directory from which the data is loaded can be specified by a command-line argument). Then, the function prompts the user to type in two names. The  `person_id_for_name`  function retrieves the id for any person (and handles prompting the user to clarify, in the event that multiple people have the same name). The function then calls the  `shortest_path`function to compute the shortest path between the two people, and prints out the path.
