## 🧐 Understanding

There are two main files in this project:  `runner.py`  and  `tictactoe.py`.  `tictactoe.py`  contains all of the logic for playing the game, and for making optimal moves.  `runner.py`  has been implemented for you, and contains all of the code to run the graphical interface for the game. Once you've downloaded the code and its dependencies, you should be able to run  `python runner.py`  to play against the AI!
