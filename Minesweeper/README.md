## üåâ Background

### Minesweeper

Minesweeper is a puzzle game that consists of a grid of cells, where some of the cells contain hidden ‚Äúmines.‚Äù Clicking on a cell that contains a mine detonates the mine, and causes the user to lose the game. Clicking on a ‚Äúsafe‚Äù cell (i.e., a cell that does not contain a mine) reveals a number that indicates how many neighboring cells ‚Äì where a neighbor is a cell that is one square to the left, right, up, down, or diagonal from the given cell ‚Äì contain a mine.

In this 3x3 Minesweeper game, for example, the three  `1`  values indicate that each of those cells has one neighboring cell that is a mine. The four  `0`  values indicate that each of those cells has no neighboring mine.

Given this information, a logical player could conclude that there must be a mine in the lower-right cell and that there is no mine in the upper-left cell, for only in that case would the numerical labels on each of the other cells be accurate.

The goal of the game is to flag (i.e., identify) each of the mines. In many implementations of the game, including the one in this project, the player can flag a mine by right-clicking on a cell (or two-finger clicking, depending on the computer).

### Propositional Logic

Your goal in this project will be to build an AI that can play Minesweeper. Recall that knowledge-based agents make decisions by considering their knowledge base, and making inferences based on that knowledge.

One way we could represent an AI‚Äôs knowledge about a Minesweeper game is by making each cell a propositional variable that is true if the cell contains a mine, and false otherwise.

What information does the AI have access to? Well, the AI would know every time a safe cell is clicked on and would get to see the number for that cell. Consider the following Minesweeper board, where the middle cell has been revealed, and the other cells have been labeled with an identifying letter for the sake of discussion.

![Middle cell with labeled neighbors](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/projects/1/minesweeper/images/middle_safe.png)

What information do we have now? It appears we now know that one of the eight neighboring cells is a mine. Therefore, we could write a logical expression like the below to indicate that one of the neighboring cells is a mine.

```
Or(A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H)
```

But we actually know more than what this expression says. The above logical sentence expresses the idea that at least one of those eight variables is true. But we can make a stronger statement than that: we know that  **_exactly_**  one of the eight variables is true. This gives us a propositional logic sentence like the below.

```
Or(
    And(A, Not(B), Not(C), Not(D), Not(E), Not(F), Not(G), Not(H)),
    And(Not(A), B, Not(C), Not(D), Not(E), Not(F), Not(G), Not(H)),
    And(Not(A), Not(B), C, Not(D), Not(E), Not(F), Not(G), Not(H)),
    And(Not(A), Not(B), Not(C), D, Not(E), Not(F), Not(G), Not(H)),
    And(Not(A), Not(B), Not(C), Not(D), E, Not(F), Not(G), Not(H)),
    And(Not(A), Not(B), Not(C), Not(D), Not(E), F, Not(G), Not(H)),
    And(Not(A), Not(B), Not(C), Not(D), Not(E), Not(F), G, Not(H)),
    And(Not(A), Not(B), Not(C), Not(D), Not(E), Not(F), Not(G), H)
)
```

That‚Äôs quite a complicated expression! And that‚Äôs just to express what it means for a cell to have a  `1`  in it. If a cell has a  `2`  or  `3`  or some other value, the expression could be even longer.

Trying to perform model checking on this type of problem, too, would quickly become intractable: on an 8x8 grid, the size Microsoft uses for its Beginner level, we‚Äôd have 64 variables, and therefore 2^64 possible models to check ‚Äì far too many for a computer to compute in any reasonable amount of time. We need a better representation of knowledge for this problem.

### Knowledge Representation

Instead, we‚Äôll represent each sentence of our AI‚Äôs knowledge like the below.

```
{A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H} = 1
```

Every logical sentence in this representation has two parts: a set of  `cells`  on the board that are involved in the sentence, and a number  `count`, representing the count of how many of those cells are mines. The above logical sentence says that out of cells A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H, exactly 1 of them is a mine.

Why is this a useful representation? In part, it lends itself well to certain types of inference. Consider the game below.

![Minesweeper game where cells can be inferred as safe](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/projects/1/minesweeper/images/infer_safe.png)

Using the knowledge from the lower-left number, we could construct the sentence  `{D, E, G} = 0`  to mean that out of cells D, E, and G, exactly 0 of them are mines. Intuitively, we can infer from that sentence that all of the cells must be safe. By extension, any time we have a sentence whose  `count`  is  `0`, we know that all of that sentence‚Äôs  `cells`  must be safe.

Similarly, consider the game below.

![Minesweeper game where cells can be inferred as mines](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/projects/1/minesweeper/images/infer_mines.png)

Our AI would construct the sentence  `{E, F, H} = 3`. Intuitively, we can infer that all of E, F, and H are mines. More generally, any time the number of  `cells`  is equal to the  `count`, we know that all of that sentence‚Äôs  `cells`  must be mines.

In general, we‚Äôll only want our sentences to be about  `cells`  that are not yet known to be either safe or mines. This means that, once we know whether a cell is a mine or not, we can update our sentences to simplify them and potentially draw new conclusions.

For example, if our AI knew the sentence  `{A, B, C} = 2`, we don‚Äôt yet have enough information to conclude anything. But if we were told that C were safe, we could remove  `C`  from the sentence altogether, leaving us with the sentence  `{A, B} = 2`  (which, incidentally, does let us draw some new conclusions.)

Likewise, if our AI knew the sentence  `{A, B, C} = 2`, and we were told that C is a mine, we could remove  `C`  from the sentence and decrease the value of  `count`  (since C was a mine that contributed to that count), giving us the sentence  `{A, B} = 1`. This is logical: if two out of A, B, and C are mines, and we know that C is a mine, then it must be the case that out of A and B, exactly one of them is a mine.

If we‚Äôre being even more clever, there‚Äôs one final type of inference we can do.

![Minesweeper game where inference by subsets is possible](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/projects/1/minesweeper/images/subset_inference.png)

Consider just the two sentences our AI would know based on the top middle cell and the bottom middle cell. From the top middle cell, we have  `{A, B, C} = 1`. From the bottom middle cell, we have  `{A, B, C, D, E} = 2`. Logically, we could then infer a new piece of knowledge, that  `{D, E} = 1`. After all, if two of A, B, C, D, and E are mines, and only one of A, B, and C are mines, then it stands to reason that exactly one of D and E must be the other mine.

More generally, any time we have two sentences  `set1 = count1`  and  `set2 = count2`  where  `set1`  is a subset of  `set2`, then we can construct the new sentence  `set2 - set1 = count2 - count1`. Consider the example above to ensure you understand why that‚Äôs true.

So using this method of representing knowledge, we can write an AI agent that can gather knowledge about the Minesweeper board, and hopefully select cells it knows to be safe!

## üßê Understanding


There are two main files in this project:  `runner.py`  and  `minesweeper.py`.  `minesweeper.py`  contains all of the logic the game itself and for the AI to play the game.  `runner.py`  has been implemented for you, and contains all of the code to run the graphical interface for the game. Once you‚Äôve downloaded the code and its dependencies, you should be able to run  `python runner.py`  to play Minesweeper (or let your AI play for you)!

Let‚Äôs open up  `minesweeper.py`  to understand what‚Äôs provided. There are three classes defined in this file,  `Minesweeper`, which handles the gameplay;  `Sentence`, which represents a logical sentence that contains both a set of  `cells`  and a  `count`; and  `MinesweeperAI`, which handles inferring which moves to make based on knowledge.

Notice in the `Minesweeper` class that each cell is a pair  `(i, j)`  where  `i`  is the row number (ranging from  `0`  to  `height - 1`) and  `j`  is the column number (ranging from  `0`to  `width - 1`).

The  `Sentence`  class is used to represent logical sentences of the form described in the Background. Each sentence has a set of  `cells`within it and a  `count`  of how many of those cells are mines. The class also contains functions  `known_mines`  and  `known_safes`  for determining if any of the cells in the sentence are known to be mines or known to be safe. It also contains functions  `mark_mine`  and  `mark_safe`to update a sentence in response to new information about a cell.

Finally, the  `MinesweeperAI`  class implements an AI that can play Minesweeper. The AI class keeps track of a number of values.  `self.moves_made`  contains a set of all cells already clicked on, so the AI knows not to pick those again.  `self.mines`  contains a set of all cells known to be mines.  `self.safes`  contains a set of all cells known to be safe. And  `self.knowledge`  contains a list of all of the  `Sentence`s that the AI knows to be true.

The  `mark_mine`  function adds a cell to  `self.mines`, so the AI knows that it is a mine. It also loops over all sentences in the AI‚Äôs  `knowledge`and informs each sentence that the cell is a mine, so that the sentence can update itself accordingly if it contains information about that mine. The  `mark_safe`  function does the same thing, but for safe cells instead.
