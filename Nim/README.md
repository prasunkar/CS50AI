## üåâ Background

Recall that in the game Nim, we begin with some number of piles, each with some number of objects. Players take turns: on a player‚Äôs turn, the player removes any non-negative number of objects from any one non-empty pile. Whoever removes the last object loses.

There‚Äôs some simple strategy you might imagine for this game: if there‚Äôs only one pile and three objects left in it, and it‚Äôs your turn, your best bet is to remove two of those objects, leaving your opponent with the third and final object to remove. But if there are more piles, the strategy gets considerably more complicated. In this problem, we‚Äôll build an AI to learn the strategy for this game through reinforcement learning. By playing against itself repeatedly and learning from experience, eventually our AI will learn which actions to take and which actions to avoid.

In particular, we‚Äôll use Q-learning for this project. Recall that in Q-learning, we try to learn a reward value (a number) for every  `(state, action)`  pair. An action that loses the game will have a reward of -1, an action that results in the other player losing the game will have a reward of 1, and an action that results in the game continuing has an immediate reward of 0, but will also have some future reward.

How will we represent the states and actions inside of a Python program? A ‚Äústate‚Äù of the Nim game is just the current size of all of the piles. A state, for example, might be  `[1, 1, 3, 5]`, representing the state with 1 object in pile 0, 1 object in pile 1, 3 objects in pile 2, and 5 objects in pile 3. An ‚Äúaction‚Äù in the Nim game will be a pair of integers  `(i, j)`, representing the action of taking  `j`  objects from pile  `i`. So the action  `(3, 5)`  represents the action ‚Äúfrom pile 3, take away 5 objects.‚Äù Applying that action to the state  `[1, 1, 3, 5]`  would result in the new state  `[1, 1, 3, 0]`  (the same state, but with pile 3 now empty).

Recall that the key formula for Q-learning is below. Every time we are in a state  `s`  and take an action  `a`, we can update the Q-value  `Q(s, a)`according to:

```
Q(s, a) <- Q(s, a) + alpha * (new value estimate - old value estimate)
```

In the above formula,  `alpha`  is the learning rate (how much we value new information compared to information we already have). The  `new value estimate`  represents the sum of the reward received for the current action and the estimate of all the future rewards that the player will receive. The  `old value estimate`  is just the existing value for  `Q(s, a)`. By applying this formula every time our AI takes a new action, over time our AI will start to learn which actions are better in any state.

## üßê Understanding

First, open up  `nim.py`. There are two classes defined in this file (`Nim`and  `NimAI`) along with two functions (`train`  and  `play`).

Take a look at the  `Nim`  class, which defines how a Nim game is played. In the  `__init__`  function, notice that every Nim game needs to keep track of a list of piles, a current player (0 or 1), and the winner of the game (if one exists). The  `available_actions`  function returns a set of all the available actions in a state. For example,  `Nim.available_actions([2, 1, 0, 0])`  returns the set  `{(0, 1), (1, 1), (0, 2)}`, since the three possible actions are to take either 1 or 2 objects from pile 0, or to take 1 object from pile 1.

The remaining functions are used to define the gameplay: the  `other_player`  function determines who the opponent of a given player is,  `switch_player`  changes the current player to the opposing player, and  `move`  performs an action on the current state and switches the current player to the opposing player.

Next, take a look at the  `NimAI`  class, which defines our AI that will learn to play Nim. Notice that in the  `__init__`  function, we start with an empty  `self.q`  dictionary. The  `self.q`  dictionary will keep track of all of the current Q-values learned by our AI by mapping  `(state, action)`pairs to a numerical value. As an implementation detail, though we usually represent  `state`  as a list, since lists can‚Äôt be used as Python dictionary keys, I have instead used a tuple version of the state when getting or setting values in  `self.q`.

For example, if we wanted to set the Q-value of the state  `[0, 0, 0, 2]`and the action  `(3, 2)`  to  `-1`, we would write something like

```
self.q[(0, 0, 0, 2), (3, 2)] = -1
```

Notice, too, that every  `NimAI`  object has an  `alpha`  and  `epsilon`  value that will be used for Q-learning and for action selection, respectively.

The  `update`  function takes as input state  `old_state`, an action take in that state  `action`, the resulting state after performing that action  `new_state`, and an immediate reward for taking that action  `reward`. The function then performs Q-learning by first getting the current Q-value for the state and action (by calling  `get_q_value`), determining the best possible future rewards (by calling  `best_future_reward`), and then using both of those values to update the Q-value (by calling  `update_q_value`).

Finally, the last function is the  `choose_action`function, which selects an action to take in a given state (either greedily, or using the epsilon-greedy algorithm).

The  `Nim`  and  `NimAI`  classes are ultimately used in the  `train`  and  `play`  functions. The  `train`  function trains an AI by running  `n`simulated games against itself, returning the fully trained AI. The  `play`function accepts a trained AI as input, and lets a human player play a game of Nim against the AI.
