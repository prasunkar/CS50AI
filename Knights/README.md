# ‚öîÔ∏è Knights Project

**Objective:** Write a program to solve logic puzzles.

## üåâ Background

In 1978, logician Raymond Smullyan published ‚ÄúWhat is the name of this book?‚Äù, a book of logical puzzles. Among the puzzles in the book were a class of puzzles that Smullyan called ‚ÄúKnights and Knaves‚Äù puzzles.

In a Knights and Knaves puzzle, the following information is given: Each character is either a knight or a knave. A knight will always tell the truth: if knight states a sentence, then that sentence is true. Conversely, a knave will always lie: if a knave states a sentence, then that sentence is false.

The objective of the puzzle is, given a set of sentences spoken by each of the characters, determine, for each character, whether that character is a knight or a knave.

For example, consider a simple puzzle with just a single character named A. A says ‚ÄúI am both a knight and a knave.‚Äù

Logically, we might reason that if A were a knight, then that sentence would have to be true. But we know that the sentence cannot possibly be true, because A cannot be both a knight and a knave ‚Äì we know that each character is either a knight or a knave, but not both. So, we could conclude, A must be a knave.

That puzzle was on the simpler side. With more characters and more sentences, the puzzles can get trickier! Your task in this problem is to determine how to represent these puzzles using propositional logic, such that an AI running a model-checking algorithm could solve these puzzles for us.

## üßê Understanding

Take a look at  `logic.py`. No need to understand everything in this file, but notice that this file defines several classes for different types of logical connectives. These classes can be composed within each other, so an expression like  `And(Not(A), Or(B, C))`  represents the logical sentence stating that symbol  `A`  is not true, and that symbol  `B`  or symbol  `C`  is true (where ‚Äúor‚Äù here refers to inclusive, not exclusive, or).

Recall that  `logic.py`  also contains a function  `model_check`.  `model_check`  takes a knowledge base and a query. The knowledge base is a single logical sentence: if multiple logical sentences are known, they can be joined together in an  `And`  expression.  `model_check`  recursively considers all possible models, and returns  `True`  if the knowledge base entails the query, and returns  `False`  otherwise.

Now, take a look at  `puzzle.py`. At the top, we‚Äôve defined six propositional symbols.  `AKnight`, for example, represents the sentence that ‚ÄúA is a knight,‚Äù while  `AKnave`  represents the sentence that ‚ÄúA is a knave.‚Äù We‚Äôve similarly defined propositional symbols for characters B and C as well.

What follows are four different knowledge bases,  `knowledge0`,  `knowledge1`,  `knowledge2`, and  `knowledge3`, which will contain the knowledge needed to deduce the solutions to the upcoming Puzzles 0, 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

The  `main`  function of this  `puzzle.py`  loops over all puzzles, and uses model checking to compute, given the knowledge for that puzzle, whether each character is a knight or a knave, printing out any conclusions that the model checking algorithm is able to make.
